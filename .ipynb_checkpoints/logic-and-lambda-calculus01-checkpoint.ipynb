    "Here are some potential difficulties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Negation Interpretation\n",
    "Challenge: Understanding how negation works in logic can be tricky. In the sentence \"If Alex is not smart, Lydia is not happy,\" using ¬𝑆𝐴 → ¬𝐻𝐿  captures the intended meaning, but it can be confusing to remember that negation applies to the entire proposition. So, Ensure clarity on what each variable represents. It's important to explicitly state that ¬𝑆𝐴   means \"Alex is not smart\" and ¬𝐻𝐿 means \"Lydia is not happy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Ambiguity in Language\n",
    "Natural language can often be ambiguous. For instance, in the statement about Alex or George playing the piano, it's not always clear if \"they\" refers to both or to either. Hence, define the logical structure clearly, indicating that \"they are musical\" applies to both Alex and George if either plays the piano.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Logical Implications\n",
    "Understanding implications can be difficult. The structure 𝑃 → 𝑄 does not mean that 𝑃 and Q are equivalent; it means if 𝑃 is true, 𝑄 must be true, but Q can be true even if P is false. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, translating natural language into propositional logic requires careful consideration of the meaning behind each statement and how negation, conjunction, and disjunction operate. Clarifying variable meanings and practicing the translation process can help mitigate these difficulties."

    "Difficulties encountered:\n",
    "1)\tExpressing \"exactly one\" is more complicated than simply using an existential quantifier (∃). It requires the use of both existential and universal quantifiers, along with the equality symbol (=), to ensure that if another entity satisfies the condition, it must be the same as the first one. The formula for \"exactly one\" includes a second universal quantification to ensure that no two distinct entities satisfy the condition. This can be tricky to express in FOL without confusion.\n",
    "2)\tFor sentences like \"Charlie knows a woman who likes George,\" it's important to maintain the relationship between predicates and variables. In this case, the formula must ensure that the woman (w) both likes George and is known by Charlie, which requires careful use of conjunctions. The formula was written as exists w (W(w) & K(Charlie, w) & L(w, George)), using a conjunction of predicates under the same existential quantifier.\n",
    "3)\tIn some sentences, like \"George admires everybody and Lydia admires nobody,\" we needed to use both universal quantifiers (∀) and negated existential quantifiers (¬∃), which can become complex to structure correctly. The formula forall p (A(George, p)) & ~exists p (A(Lydia, p)) was used to ensure George admires everyone, while Lydia admires no one. Ensuring the proper order of quantifiers and negations is crucial here to avoid logical misinterpretations.\n",
    "4)\tSentences like \"Nobody admires everybody\" required careful placement of negation (¬). Incorrect placement of negation with respect to quantifiers can lead to unintended interpretations. The sentence was translated to ~exists p (all q (A(p, q))) to correctly express that no individual admires everyone.     "
